# Hi, I'm Imma-Spring!
I'm a programming language enthusiast who loves creating new programming languages. I'm competent in Java, C++, and C, but I'm always eager to learn more programming languages and explore new technologies.

## Programming Languages
### Java
I've been using Java for about a year now and have worked on a couple personal progects for school. The course I'm taking focuses on Java so I'm decently competent in it

### C++
I also have been learing c++ in my free time. Curently the only project I've done in c++ is RAC but I plan on doing more.

### C
I havent been doing much in c but I enjoy the language a lot and am at least semi-competent in it.

### Other Languages
I plan on learing a large number of other languages such as Haskell, Zig, and more. I have some basic understanding of JavaScript and Python.

## Projects
### [RAC]
[RAC] is a very basic programming language. It is the first language I've made so it is quite simple.
